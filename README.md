Email verifier system for websites

## How does it works?
After you type an email in the TextBox, you will receive a code in that mail's inbox.  
For doing this, you will need an smtp server access and a mail.  
You will need to use [smtpJS](https://www.smtpjs.com/)
# NOTE:
## This source just let the user know if the code is right or not, does not actually verify any account! This source is just meant to help building the initial verifier.
