## How does it works?
It just send an email with a code to an email address, after that you will simply need to insert that code in the right textbox!  
You will need to use [smtpJS](https://www.smtpjs.com/) to send the mail with the code.  

# Note!
This source does not actually verify an account, it just send a code to an email, and after that tells you if the code you insert in the textbox is right or not!  This source is just meant to the make an initial verification system, you have to create and connect a database to the source to actually verify an account!
